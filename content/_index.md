description: I am a statistics PhD student at the [Statistical Learning and Data Science](https://www.slds.stat.uni-muenchen.de/) chair at [LMU Munich](https://www.lmu.de/en/index.html) supervised by [Bernd Bischl](https://www.slds.stat.uni-muenchen.de/people/bischl/). My research focuses on AutoML, Algorithmic Fairness and Benchmarking. My current interests lie in practical aspects of algorithmic fairness and how practitioners can be enabled to develop more equitable algorithms. I also develop Open Source software, mostly for the [mlr3](https://github.com/mlr-org/mlr3) ecosystem in R.
