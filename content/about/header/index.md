  About Me

<!-- this is a subheadline -->
I am currently finishing my PhD in Statistics at LMU Munich advised by Prof. Bernd Bischl expecting to graduate in the fall of 2022.

The goal of my research is to facilitate access to machine learning methods to a broader audience including domain experts and citizen data scientists. I hope to contribute to this goal via my [research](/research/) in machine learning, AutoML, algorithmic fairness and benchmarking. I also enjoy developing and contributing to Open Source [software](/software/) mainly in R.

### Background 
Prior to starting my PhD I completed a B.Sc. as well as a M.Sc. in Statistics at LMU Munich with two exchanges at **Universidad Complutense de Madrid** and **Universitat Politècnica de Catalunya (Barcelona)**.

Throughout my studies I worked part time at several companies such as [Telefónica Germany](https://www.telefonica.de/home-corporate-en.html) where I worked on automated quality control for data bases, risk scoring and text analytics. 
During my master's thesis at the [Bosch Center for Artificial Intelligence (BCAI)](https://www.bosch-ai.com/) I worked on a method for anomaly detection in time-series data. Before finishing my degree, I interned at [Telefónica Alpha](https://www.linkedin.com/company/telefonica-innovacion-alpha/) in Barcelona working on a moonshot project related to mental health and personal wellbeing. During my PhD I interned with [Roche Pharma](https://www.roche.ch/en/pharma.htm) in personalised healthcare working on *domain generalization* for clinical survival models. 

During my PhD i furthermore freelanced in several capacities, e.g. holding programming courses and machine learning / deep learning courses at several **DAX** companies but also applied machine learning/computer vision projects.

### Teaching 

I am currently teaching the [Innovation Lab Big Data Science](https://innolab.ifi.lmu.de/) where I supervise student groups on machine learning  and data science software development projects provided by companies, NGO's and research institutions.
